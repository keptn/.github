Keptn is an event-driven orchestration engine for cloud-native apps.
Started in 2018,
It uses a declarative approach to build scalable automation

Keptn evaluates _Service Level Indicators (SLOs)_ and provides a dashboard, alerts, and auto-remediation for them.
It also provides [integrations](https://keptn.sh/docs/integrations/)
with the Cloud Native ecosystem 
including _Prometheus_, _ArgoCD_, _CloudEvents_, _Backstage_,
and many other cloud-native projects.

Keptn a member project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io).
