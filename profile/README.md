Keptn integrates seamlessly with cloud-native deployment tools such as ArgoCD, Flux, and Gitlab to bring application
awareness to your Kubernetes cluster. Keptn supplements the standard deployment tools with features to help you ensure
that your deployments are in a healthy state.

For information about the history of the Keptn project, see the [Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit is now Keptn!](https://medium.com/keptn/keptn-lifecycle-toolkit-is-now-keptn-e0812217bf46) blog post.

Keptn includes multiple features that can be implemented independently or together.
It targets three main use cases: Metrics, Observability, and Release lifecycle management.

Keptn is a member project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io).
